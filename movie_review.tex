	% I am thinking over writing about Rang De Basanti and 3 Idiots.
	\section*{Rang De Basanti}
	\textbf{Director:}  Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra \\
	\textbf{Starring:} Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi, R Madhavan, and Soha Ali Khan\\
	\textbf{Rating:} {4.4}/{5}\\\\
	Rang De Basanti is one of the best patriotic Hindi movies made in the recent times.	This story is about six friends who help an English filmmaker create a documentary about Indian freedom struggle. During filming, this group of friends learn about those before them and the importance of fighting for their rights.\\
    The youngsters are able to connect with the movie because of the plot being set up in college life. This is one of the movies which literally moves up aperson from inside and stirs up feelings of patriotism. It also features some real good music like "Rooaroo" and "Khalbali". Overall this was a movie worth watching in theatres.

	\section*{3 Idiots}
    \textbf{Director:} Raju Hirani\\
    \textbf{Actors:} Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi, R. Madhavan, Kareena Kapoor\\
    \textbf{Rating:} {4.2}/{5}\\\\
    3 Idiots is a movie that tries to emphasise on the current situation of students in the education system of our country which promotes the blind race to get more marks rather than actually learning. \\
    Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with their fellow collegian, Rancho, after faking a stroke aboard an Air India plane. Enroute, they encounter another student, Chatur Ramalingam, now a successful businessman, who reminds them of a bet they had undertaken 10 years ago. The trio, while recollecting hilarious antics, including their run-ins with the Dean of Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, Viru Sahastrabudhe, race to locate Rancho, at his last known address - little knowing the secret that was kept from them all this time.\\
    3 Idiots doesn't fail to put an element of comedy even though being a movie on a serious topic. It also features some great songs like "Give me some Sunshine" and "Behti Hawa Sa Tha Woh". To conclude 3 Idiots has great potential and conveys the message very strongly along with good entertainment provided throughout.
